Steps for branching in git-

1. git branch branch_name
2. git branch (checking number of branches are available and on which branch you are at currently. '*' tells the current branch)
3. git checkout branch_name (choosing your branch)
4. do your code changes in files
5. git status
6. git diff
7. git add -A
8. git commit -m "modified code for branch"

After all this the code is only committed to your local branch_name branch.
This has no effect on our local master branch and no effect on remote repo.

9. git push -u origin branch_name (-u = associate local branch_name branch to remote branch_name branch. "origin" = name of remote repo)
10. git branch -a (to see all branches)

Merging a branch to master

11. git checkout master
12. git pull origin master
13. git branch --merged
14. git merge branch_name
15. git push origin master

Deleting a Branch. As now branch is no longer needed it should be deleted

16. git branch --merged
17. git branch -d branch_name
18. git branch -a
19. git push origin --delete branch_name
