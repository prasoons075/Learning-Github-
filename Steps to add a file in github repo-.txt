Steps to add a file in github repo-

1. git clone "repo url"
2. add the new file to the clone repo folder
3. git status (checking all the untracked files which we have kept in the cloned repo folder)
4. git add "file name to be added"
5. git add . (adding multiple files)
6. git reset file_name (if ou want to remove a file which you have added accidently to staging area when adding multiple files)
7. git commit -m "comment for the files you have added"
8. git push (might ask your id and pass incase the authentication is not done)
9. git status (no untracked files left)
